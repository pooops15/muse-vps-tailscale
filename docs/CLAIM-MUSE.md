> This is the referral code of this repository's author. Do not confuse it
> with other people's codes you may see online.

## Before you start

Prepare:

- A Google/email account for Muse registration
- A browser
- For the VPN route: a trusted VPN with a server in the **United States**
  or **Canada**
- For the no-VPN route: a spare Google account is recommended, because
  sign-in happens through a third-party service called Airtap

Choose **one** of the two routes below.

## Route A — Use a US/Canada VPN

1. Turn on the VPN and select a **United States** or **Canada** server.
2. Keep the VPN connected during registration and code redemption.
3. Open **[https://muse.ai/join](https://muse.ai/join)**.
4. Register a new Muse account as usual until you reach the Dashboard.
5. Redeem the referral code using the steps in **How to redeem the code**
   below.
6. Make sure the page reports that the code was accepted. Merely opening a
   link or typing the code does not prove a successful redemption.

If the page still shows a regional restriction, try another US/Canada
server and refresh the page.

## Route B — No VPN, through Airtap

This route uses Airtap's browser/environment, so you do not install a VPN
on your own device.

1. Open **[https://legacy.airtap.ai/app/login](https://legacy.airtap.ai/app/login)**.
2. Register or sign in to Airtap. Use a spare Google account; sign in only
   through the official Google button/flow and never enter a Google
   password into a suspicious third-party form.
3. After entering the Airtap environment/browser, open Chrome or the
   browser available there.
4. Go to **[https://muse.ai/join](https://muse.ai/join)**.
5. Register a new Muse account as usual until you reach the Dashboard.
6. Redeem the referral code using the steps below.

Airtap's availability and behavior can change. If this route no longer
works, use Route A.

## How to redeem the code

Do this **within 48 hours after the Muse account is created**.

### On the Muse website

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **General → Usage → Redeem invite code**.
3. Enter this code exactly:

<div align="center">

# `IB4FJR`

</div>

4. Click the confirmation button.
5. Read the result on screen: accepted, invalid, already used, or outside
   the redemption window.

### In the mobile app

1. Open **Settings** in the Muse app.
2. Select **Redeem token**.
3. Enter **`IB4FJR`** and confirm.

> Redemption lives inside **Muse** Settings—not the phone's system
> Settings and not WhatsApp or another messaging app.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try this |
|---|---|
| Still regionally blocked while using a VPN | Switch to another US/Canada server, confirm the VPN is still connected, then refresh |
| Airtap does not open its browser/environment | Wait briefly and retry; if it still fails, use Route A |
| Cannot find the code field | Check the path: website under **General → Usage**; mobile app under **Redeem token** |
| Code is rejected | Read the result shown on screen. Do not retry endlessly; the code may be invalid, used, or past its 48-hour window |
| More than 48 hours have passed | Referral redemption may no longer be available for that account. Muse's displayed result controls |

## After Muse is active, continue to muse-vps-tailscale

An active Muse account lives in a VM you normally talk to through chat.
This project lets you enter that VM for real, with **SSH over
Tailscale** — private, key-only (no passwords), and with no 60-minute
limit:

- the Muse VM calls out to your laptop over the tailnet and parks one
  port there;
- you walk in through that parked port, from your own laptop's terminal;
- no public address is opened, and no company relay sits in the middle.
